# Stay22-Map-Challenge

---

## Setup

Local web server needed to generate/load the data files (Ex: XAMPP's Apache HTTP Server). Otherwise, please see below.  

## Link to Webpage 


## What It Does

Using an open-source JS library (Leaflet) to build a web mapping application.

## How I Built It
```
- HMTL/CSS (scripting/styling)
- Vanilla JS + JQuery (functionality)
- JSON/GeoJSON (generate/load data points)
```
## What I Learned 
How to use GeoJSON to represent simple geographical features on a map, such as points and line strings.

### Mapbox vs. Leaflet
        
Given the requirements of this technical challenge, I knew that Mapbox wouldn't be the best choice, as it's meant for complex maps which hold a lot of data. Since I wasn't dealing with a large amount of data but still needed some interactivity, Leaflet was my best choice. Leaflet provided me with simplicity in my design, and the performance needed for my application to work efficiently across different platforms. I will surely use this platform for future work involving maps!
