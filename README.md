Inspiration Technical problem to test my front-end development skills.

## What it does

Using an open-source JS library (Leaflet) to build a web mapping application.

## How I built it
```
- HMTL/CSS
- Vanilla JS + JQuery
- JSON/GeoJSON.
```
## What I learned 
How to use GeoJSON to represent simple geographical features on a map, such as points and line strings.<br>

        # Mapbox vs. Leaflet
        Given the requirements of this technical challenge, I knew that Mapbox would be a bit complex to setup/run appropriately. Since I         wasn't dealing with a large amount of data but still needed some interactivity, Leaflet was my best choice.
        Leaflet provided me with simplicity in my design, and the performance in my functions needed to work efficiently across different         platforms. I will surely use this application in future work involving maps!
